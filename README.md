### 1 General Omnigo Information

#### 1.1 What is the HP OmniGo 100/120 Organizer Plus?

The OmniGo is a small personal computer which is designed to be an electronic organizer. It has a small 67 key keyboard, a plastic stylus and a square monochrome LCD screen. The plastic stylus can be used draw electronic ink or to input text using Graffiti handwriting recognition. The keyboard can also fold behind the screen so the OmniGo can be held and used solely for pen input.
 
The OmniGo includes a complete set of personal information management (PIM) applications including an Appointment Book, Phone Book, Calculator, Data Base, Note Pad and a Spreadsheet. It also includes a complete set of Financial utilities including Time Value of Money (TVM), Cash Flows, Business percentage, Compound interest, Solver, List statistics, Conversions, Date Calculations, and an HP 12C financial calculator emulator. Pocket Quicken is included in the OmniGo 120.
 
The OmniGo is in the category of devices such as the Sharp Zaurus, but also competes somewhat with the Palm Pilot, Apple Newton, Sony Magic Link, Psion 3a, Hewlett Packard's 200LX, and the new Windows CE devices.

#### 1.2 What is the difference between the 100 and 120?

The OmniGo 120 has a brighter holographic screen, support for Compact Flash RAM cards (with adapter), Pocket Quicken, and a Clip&Go client in ROM.

#### 1.3 How does it compare to other electronic organizers?

Within the Hewlett Packard family of palmtops the OmniGo is positioned below the HP 200LX and the new HP Windows CE palmtop.
 
Some advantages of the OmniGo over other electronic organizers are it's unique combination of pen and keyboard input, a large set of built in applications, a relatively open operating system, small form, and a comparatively low price.
 
Some possible drawbacks of the device are a limited amount of built in random access memory storage for applications and data, no infrared data port, best battery performance is with disposable lithium batteries, no external power plug, two somewhat expensive proprietary desktop PC connectivity options, and no online service applications available.

#### 1.4 What operating system does the OmniGo use?

The OmniGo uses DOS and release 2.1 of the GEOS operating system. GEOS was an early (but technically more efficient) competitor to Microsoft Windows and is available for many platforms. GEOS was created by Geoworks.
 
GEOS is available on several different platforms. The desktop PC incarnations include Ensemble, GeoWorks Pro, Quick Start, and the latest New Deal Office. GEOS is also the operating system for the Casio Zoomer, the Nokia 9000 communicator, and Brother's GeoBook. Applications designed for these platforms may work on the OmniGo.

#### 1.5 What is Graffiti?

Graffiti is a handwriting recognition system which recognizes characters written using a special single stoke alphabet. Graffiti was developed by Palm Computing, a division of U.S. Robotics. An experienced user can write approximately 20 words per minute with 100% accuracy using Graffiti. On the OmniGo, you can either write Graffiti anywhere on the screen or specifically into the Graffiti window. Graffiti can used to enter information into any text field.

#### 1.6 Where can I purchase an OmniGo?

Although HP has offically discontinued the OmniGo, you can still purchase it new from various sources. Some retailers and mail order suppliers still have the OmniGo and accessories in stock. If you are in the market for a used OmniGo, you can often find one forsale in a few USENET newsgroups.
 
Best mail order prices are at [http://www.pdapage.com](https://web.archive.org/web/19981111191308/http://www.pdapage.com/).  
Newsgroups: [comp.sys.palmtops](news:comp.sys.palmtops), [comp.sys.handhelds](news:comp.sys.handhelds).

#### 1.7 What online resources exist for the OmniGo users?

Most OmniGo discussion occurs in the OmniGo mailing list. To subscribe send an e-mail to [majordomo@lifelike.com](mailto:majordomo@lifelike.com) with "subscribe ogo" somewhere in the body. An archive of previous postings to the list is available at [http://www.grot.com/zoomer/zoomer-list/archives.html](https://web.archive.org/web/19991012102353/http://grot.com/zoomer/zoomer-list/archives.html).

### 2 OmniGo Hardware

#### 2.1 Physical Characteristics.

The OmniGo measures 6" x 3.75" x 1" when folded up (15.2cm x 9.5cm x 2.5cm) and weights 11.5oz (.33kg). It has one type II PCMCIA slot on the right side of the unit and a standard RS-232 serial port on left side. The black and white FSTN (Film Super Twisted Neumatic) LCD pannel is 240 pixels by 240 pixels, with an analog touch panel. The internal speaker is capable of single tones in the 600 to 20,000Hz audible range.

#### 2.2 Hardware Specifications.

The OmniGo follows the PC XT architecture. It contains a memory controller, a system management unit, an 8259 interrupt controller and an 8254 timer. All controllers are PC XT compatible. The OmniGo also contains a power management controller (APM) capatible with the OmniGo BIOS.
 
The device features an NEC V-30HL CPU (80186 clone) on a Vadem VG-230 chip, running 16mhz on 5V. There is 3MB of ROM (consisting of 1 piece of 16Mbit - 120ns and 1 peice of 8Mbit - 120ns ROM). The device also contains 1MB RAM (consisting of 2 pieces of 4Mbit - 80ns SRDRAM).
 
The VG-230 contains a number of controllers mounted directly on the chip, providing "PC on a chip" functionality. The PCMCIA, memory, and LCD controllers, as well as the internal timer all exist alongside the CPU.

#### 2.3 What kind of batteries does the OmniGo use?

The OmniGo uses two "AA" batteries in series to provide 3V of main power; The system receives 5V and -24V. A 3V CR2032 lithium coin cell battery provides backup power.

#### 2.4 How much battery life does the OmniGo get?

Moderate use of the OmniGo will allow for approximately 4 weeks of use on one pair of alkaline batteries --with the same level of use, lithium batteries could be expected to last 8 weeks. Heavy users of the device report 2 weeks on alkalines, and one month on lithiums. Modem and serial port use, DOS Mode, and RAM cards shorten battery life.

**Measurements by Juraj Mucko**

Types of Batteries:
 
 *   Alkalines. These are the "normal" batteries and work well.
 *   Carbon/Zinc. These batteries are cheaper than alkalines but of course don't last as long. Might be interesting if you can get them really cheap and are ready to change batteries often.
*   NiCad rechargeables. These proivde less energy than conventional batteries (reports suggest maybe half) and they fade rapidly once their charge is nearly gone, but - they are rechargeable, and so offer a cost effective alternative.
*   Lithium AA batteries. They are 30% lighter than alkalines, and they last longer, but they are more expensive. Recommended if you really need long battery life and in extreme conditions. These batteries have a very long shelve life.
*   Rechargable Alkalines. These batteries don't cost much more than regular Alkalines, but require a special charger. They get approximately 25 full charges and are about as powerful as regular Alkalines.
 
The OmniGo has several graphical displays showing current battery life. On the Home Screen is small battery indicator which shows the power of the main battery. There is also an indicator of whether the backup battey needs replacement in the Setup application.. For more detailed information, there is a freeware program which plots battery life over time called Battery Watcher.
 
 Some tips to increase battery life:
 
 *   Turn "Touch Screen to turn on" to off in Setup.
 *   Avoid writes to FlashRAM cards.
 *   Avoid formatting FlashRAM cards.
 *   Avoid long transfers via the serial port.
 *   Avoid DOS Mode.
 
The backup battery should last approximately a year, if fresh batteries are maintained in the unit.

#### 2.5 Can I use an external power supply?

Although the OmniGo does not contain a standard adapter plug, some users have reported success with adapters plugged into the battery compartment. The following is typical design of an OmniGo AC power adapter:
 
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. MAY VOID YOUR WARRENTY.

Items Needed:

*   1 AC to DC converter 120VAC to 3VDC, 300 mA minimum (mine is 650 mA) These are available at Radio Shack for about $9-$15 (depending on mA)
*   1 0.5 inch diameter wood dowel This can be found at your local hobby store, ~$1.30 Cut to a length of 95 mm (This is maximum, slightly less is OK)
*   2 input wires preferably insulated stranded wire (not solid) cut to 12 inches length each, strip the insulation off the ends
*   2 metal wood screws (~3/32 inch diameter shanks)
*   1 round head, 1/2 inch long, 1/4 inch diameter head (NEG pole)
*   1 countersink flat head, 1/2 inch long, 3/16 inch max dia head (POS pole)
*   1 Connector Female plug to go from AC/DC converter male plug to input wires Get to match the AC/DC converter you have DO NOT get a closed circuit type as this will short the OmniGo terminals upon disconnect of the AC/DC connector plug available at Radio Shack
*   Electricians tape
*   Voltmeter (to check polarity and voltage)

Assembly Instructions:

1.  Center drill a hole into each end of the dowel, slightly less than the diameter of the screws.
2.  At the midpoint of the dowel (47.5 mm away from either end), drill one hole through the dowel large enough for both wires to fit through.
3.  Cut or carve a lengthwise channel from each end of the dowel to the center hole (I used a Dremel power tool) to provide a recess for each wire in the dowel.
4.  Screw almost all the way in both screws in the previously drilled ends, leaving enough room to wrap wire around.
5.  Pull both wires through the center hole, place each wire into its own channel, and wrap the stripped wire end around the screw beneath each screw head.
6.  Tighten the screws. NOTE: the countersink screw head MUST protrude from the end of the dowel at least 1/16 inches. If it doesn't, it will not contact the pickup on the OmniGo.
7.  Wrap electricians tape around the dowel over the wire in the dowel groove to keep it in place.
8.  Twist the remaining wire together except for the ends (helps keep the wire together).
9.  Twist or solder (recommended) leads onto the female connector. Wrap with electricians tape, separating the bare wire leads to prevent contact.
10.  To check polarity and voltage, plug the AC/DC adaptor into the female plug, plug in the adaptor to 120VAC, and test with the voltmeter across the screws BEFORE placing in the OmniGo. The flathead countersunk screw is the positive end (mark with a pen on the dowel) and the roundhead screw is the negative end (it will sit against the spring in the OmniGo).

Once you feel confident with the set up, place in the OmniGo and work away. My setup measured 3.21 Volts (ran great). Another adaptor I tested produced 4 volts on the 3 volt switch setting. The OmniGo ran fine, but I wouldn't recommend using the OmniGo at this higher voltage.

#### 2.6 Can I upgrade the internal RAM?

No. Presently there is no way to upgrade the internal RAM of the OmniGo. You can however, increase available storage by adding SRAM or FlashRAM PCMCIA cards.

#### 2.7 What is diagnostic mode?

The OmniGo firmware has a diagnostic mode for testing various parts of the OmniGo hardware. To enter diagnostic mode, reboot the OmniGo by pressing SHIFT-ON-NEXT and then hold the NEXT key. When you exit the diagnostic mode, the OmniGo will continue to boot normally.

#### 2.8 Does the OmniGo's screen need protection?

The OmniGo screen is far from scratch-proof. Furthermore, the stylus that comes with the OmniGo can become scratched or otherwise damaged, and can scratch the screen. So, be careful with your stylus, and pay close attention to its "feel" on the screen; if it feels scratchy when you're writing, you're probably scratching your screen.

There is a company called Concept Kitchen ([http://www.conceptkitchen.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20010424084421/http://www.conceptkitchen.com/)) that makes screen savers for a number of PDAs, including the OmniGo. They charge about $24 for a dozen protectors. I think their lifespan is about a month each. Their phone number is 415/929-1102, and e-mail is [Info@ConceptKitchen.Com](mailto:Info@ConceptKitchen.Com).

Another solution is to build your own screen protectors with transparency film for overhead projectors. David Virga recommends the type for inkjet/dye-sub printers, which does have a coating but does not have an opaque strip. Window cleaner removes the coating nicely. With careful marking and cutting, you can easily get nine protectors out of one letter-size transparency sheet. You can even devise a template using Freelance/PowerPoint/etc, print that on the sheet, cut apart and then clean off the coating. Each sheet lasts about three weeks before it gets marred to the point that I find it too distracting. I don't notice a significant degradation in touchscreen performance, and this film is stiff enough to install and stay in place well.

Tthe screen is 2 1/2 inches (64mm) by 3 3/8 inches (84mm). A 1/16 inch (2mm) tab fits under the edge of the screen with no apparent problem. So, try an overall template size of 2 5/8 inches (68mm) by 3 1/2 inches (88mm), and scoop out the sides to make tabs. Use a good straight edge ruler and a sharp hobby knife for best results.

#### 2.9 My OmniGo will not turn on, what can I do?

On occation some usres have found that their OmniGo refuses to turn on.  There are several reasons why your OmniGo may refuse to turn on:

1.  The operating system crashed.
2.  The batteries are drained or damaged.
3.  The battery voltage is too high.
4.  Something is fundamentally wrong with your OmniGo.

Fortunately I haven't seen any forth option yet.  You should take the following steps to try and get your OmniGo working.  At each step, check to see if your OmniGo is working.

1.  Perform a hard reset (press the button on the bottom of the OmniGo).
2.  Replace the main batteries.
3.  Remove all the batteries and leave them out for a few minutes (this will wipe all your data for sure).
4.  Try a different brand of batteries (some brands do not work).

Always press the hard reset button before anything else, it is the least damaging.

### 3 OmniGo Software Information

#### 3.1 What software exists for the OmniGo?

There is little commerical software available for the OmniGo, however there does exist a large number of shareware and freeware applications. The largest collection of OmniGo shareware and freeware is available at Max Mansour's OmniGo web site at [http://omnigo.home.ml.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20010424084421/http://omnigo.home.ml.org/).

#### 3.2 What DOS software can I run on my OmniGo?

OmniGo is a PC-XT with 512K of RAM and monochrome CGA emulation. The DOS detects as version 6.22 but the level of compatibility isn't known. Most applications which will run under such limitations should work.

#### 3.3 What are Electronic books and where can I find them?

Electronic books, also called content, are hyperlinked documents which can be read using the OmniGo bookreader. Content is available from Geoworks, FineBind, and various other sources. The Bindery application from Geoworks allows you to create your own Content.

_Content is available from:_

FindBind - [http://users.axxis.com/redirect/mfine/finebind.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20010424084421/http://users.axxis.com/redirect/mfine/finebind.html)  
Geoworks - [http://www.geoworks.com/omnigo/download.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20010424084421/http://www.geoworks.com/omnigo/download.htm)

#### 3.4 How do I reset my OmniGo?

There are a couple of ways to reset your OmniGo.  It is recommended the at you quit all applications before resetting the OmniGo.

1.  Pressing SHIFT-ON-NEXT will reboot your OmniGo and reclaim any space taken by state files.
2.  Pressing a pin into the small hole at the back of your OmniGo will perform a hard reset.   You need to do this if your OmniGo hangs.  You'll lose the time & date after this kind of reset.

To return your OmniGo to factory condition (erase everything) hold down "C" while the OmniGo is booting.  You'll get a prompt that says "Clear all data? (Y/N)".  Pressing "N" will cause the OmniGo to boot normally, pressing "Y" will clear all your data.

#### 3.5 Why does free memory drop over time for no reason?

Free memory on the internal RAM drive will drop over time due to state files. State files are like bookmarks in applications, so that when you close an application you can reopen it and be where you left off. GEOS uses state files to give the illusion of being able to open more applications than can fit into available memory. When you try and open an application that cannot fit into memory, GEOS silently closes one of the other loaded applications and saves its state. When you return to an application that GEOS has closed, it is reopened and its state is retieved from disk.

Unfortunately these state files can take up a lot of memory, one is created for every application that you have opened. Occationally it is good to idea to clear out these state files, this can be accomplished by resetting the OmniGo (pressing SHIFT-ON-NEXT).

You can force an application to save to state anytime by pressing FN-F3. These can be used, for example to leave the notepad, while in the middle of editing an note, to go check an appointment. When you reopen notepad you'll return to editing that note, exactly where you left off.

#### 3.6 What are IZL applications and how do I run them?

IZL applications where written using the IZL compiler and require the IZL interpreter to run them.  You can download the IZL interpreter from the IZL homepage.  IZL applications should be installed into the documents directory on your OmniGo. 

The IZL homepage is at [http://www.netaxs.com/~jferas/izl.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/19961221133743/http://www.netaxs.com/~jferas/izl.htm).

#### 3.7 How do I create an event in the appointment book?

Events appear at the top of the dialy schedual and have no start or end times.  To create an event:

1.  Select "New" from within the appointment book.
2.  Backspace out the start time; It will change to NONE.
3.  Backspace out the end time; It will change to NONE.

#### 3.8 Using passwords and locking your OmniGo.

If you have locked your OmniGo while the screen is rotated (Newton style) then you'll have to use the pen to enter your password.  The OmniGo password is case sensitive: MYSECRET is different than MySecret.  If your password is lowercase but you last used uppercase, do the "reset CAPS" stroke first (straight line going up to northwest). The case setting is indicated by a tiny up-arrow in the lower left corner of the screen.

### 4 Desktop Connectivity Information

#### 4.1 Connectivity Overview

In order to connect your OmniGo to the desktop you'll need an OmniGo serial cable and connectivity software.

HP offers two different options for connecting your OmniGo to a Windows PC: The older Connectivity Pack and the newer Link to Windows. Both allow you to backup and restore data and include a basic PIM. In order to install applications on your OmniGo from a Windows PC, you'll need the Installer from Geoworks. Geoworks also sells Clip & Go which allows Windows and your OmniGo to share a common clipboard.

If you do not use Windows, there are various shareware and freeware programs available for Macintosh, DOS, UNIX and OS/2.

In order to get a cable you can either buy one of HP's connectivity options, order one from HP, or build your own.

#### 4.2 What is the Connectivity Pack?

The Connectivity Pack is HP's first attempt at connectivity software for the OmniGo. It contains a basic phone book, appointment book and notepad application which can be syncronized with the OmniGo. It runs on both Windows 3.1 and Windows95. The serial cable is also included.

#### 4.3 What is Clip & Go?

Clip & Go, from Geoworks, allows the OmniGo and your Windows PC to share a clipboard. This means that you can cut text, ink, or spreadsheet cells from the OmniGo and paste them into Windows applications. It also allows you to paste text and spreadsheet cells from Windows to the OmniGo.

The Clip & Go application converts OmniGo data into these formats:

*   OmniGo 100 Spreadsheet data converts to WK1 format, which you can paste into Lotus 1-2-3, Microsoft Excel, and Quattro Pro spreadsheets. Excel and Quattro Pro paste surface values only (no formulas) from WK1, so Clip & Go saves a complete copy of the WK1 data to a separate file.
*   Ink converts to Windows bitmap (BMP) format with a resolution of 72 dots per inch. Ink data will not copy back from Windows to the OmniGo 100.
*   Text converts to plain text and rich text (Microsoft RTF) formats.
*   Records from the Phonebook, Appointment Book, World Clock, and Database applications convert to both plain text and rich text format.

Clip & Go is currently the only way to convert spreadsheet data to a format readable by Windows software. Link to Windows includes Clip & Go. The OmniGo 120 contains the Clip & Go client in ROM.

#### 4.4 What is Link to Windows?

Link to Windows is the latest connectivity option from HP. It is actually several applications which work together. These applications are Sync & Go, Clip & Go and the HP PIM. Sync & Go allows you to syncronize your OmniGo data with various PIMs. Clip & Go allows you to cut and paste between the OmniGo and Windows. The HP PIM is a phone book application and an appointment book application for which you can syncronize to. Link to Windows also includes the Strategy Games pack and a serial cable.

The Sync & Go application can syncronize in some form or another with the following programs:

* ACT! for Windows 2.0
* Advantage
* Day-Timer Organizer 2.x
* dBASE III/IV/V
* HP PIM
* Lotus Organizer 2.1
* NetManage ECCO 3.03
* Now Up-to-Date for Windows
* Paradox 
* Schedule+ 1.0 & 7.0
* Sidekick for Windows 1.0 & 2.0
* Sidekick 95
* Windows Cardfile/Calendar

#### 4.5 What is the Installer?

OmniGo software is often available in the form of a GEOS Package. A GEOS Package, with the GPK extension, contains files to be installed. The Installer, from Geoworks, allows you to install and uninstall OmniGo software contained within packages. It is freely available from Geoworks on there web site at [http://www.geoworks.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20010424084421/http://www.geoworks.com/) but is available for Windows 3.1 and Windows95 only.

If you do not have Windows, there is a freeware IZL application called UNGPK which can be used to extract the contents of a GPK file on the OmniGo.  For UNIX and OS/2, the OgINST and OgFTP programs can be used to install GEOS packages.

Visit Asher Hoskins' OmniGo Hompage at [http://domestic1.sjc.ox.ac.uk/~ahoskins/omnigo/](https://web.archive.org/web/20010429040246/http://domestic1.sjc.ox.ac.uk/~ahoskins/play/omnigo/) to download OgFTP and OgINST.

#### 4.6 What if I use DOS?

Omnicom is a freeware connectivity program for the OmniGo. It runs in DOS and allows you to perform basic file management as well as upload and download files. Omnicom is a useful utiltity even if you already have one of the various other connectivity options, if fact, many of the advanced tricks in this FAQ require you use it.

You can get Omnicom from [http://omnigo.home.ml.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20010424084421/http://omnigo.home.ml.org/).

#### 4.7 What if I have a Macintosh?

If you have a Macintosh you can use MacPCCOM and Mac On The Go to backup and restore data. You'll need a proper serial cable to connect your Macintosh to the OmniGo.  In order to install OmniGo applications stored in GEOS packages (files with the .GPK file extension) you'll need an IZL application called UNGPK.

You can get MacPCCOM and Mac On The Go from [http://omnigo.home.ml.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20010424084421/http://omnigo.home.ml.org/).

#### 4.8 What if I use UNIX or OS/2?

If you use UNIX or OS/2 you'll need a copy OgFTP, from Asher Hoskins, to connect your OmniGo to your UNIX or OS/2 desktop. OgFTP will allow you to transfer files to and from the OmniGo. To install applications, you'll need a copy of OgINST as well. OgINST will extract the application from a GEOS Package and then use OgFTP to upload the application to your OmniGo.

Visit Asher Hoskins' OmniGo Hompage at [http://domestic1.sjc.ox.ac.uk/~ahoskins/omnigo/](https://web.archive.org/web/20010429040246/http://domestic1.sjc.ox.ac.uk/~ahoskins/play/omnigo/) to download OgFTP and OgINST.

### 5 Memory and Memory Expansion

#### 5.1 How can I increase the OmniGo's storage capacity?

The OmniGo supports both SRAM and FlashRAM PC Cards for storage. The OmniGo 120 can also support compact flash with an adapter. These cards plug into the PCMCIA card slot on the right side of the unit and act like an additional disk drive.

#### 5.2 What is the difference between SRAM and FlashRAM?

SRAM cards use Static RAM to store information. SRAM is capable of storing information using a very small amount of charge. SRAM cards use a tiny watch battery, which lasts about a year, to keep the contents of RAM. SRAM is quite expensive, so a typical SRAM card cost more per megabyte than a FlashRAM card. The advantage of SRAM is that it doesn't require as much power to write to as FlashRAM.

FlashRAM is a type of Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM). When writing information to a FlashRAM card, the information is "burned-in". To write to the same area again, it must be "Flashed" or cleared of its contents (this process is automatic). Typically, writing to FlashRAM requires considerably more power than SRAM cards. Reading, however, requires about the same amount of power as SRAM. The advantage of FlashRAM is that it is usually less expensive per megabyte than SRAM.

#### 5.3 Why don't all SRAM and FlashRAM cards work on the OmniGo?

Like many Palmtops, the OmniGo can only accept certain kinds of RAM cards. This is partly because not all cards are compatable with the OmniGo software and partly because the OmniGo can't supply enough power to PCMCIA cards designed for larger machines. Make sure to ask, when ordering the card, whether it has been tested to work in the OmniGo.

ATA FrashRAM cards work in the OmniGo without any special drivers. If you wish to purchase a FlashRAM make sure that it is ATA or comes with OmniGo compatible drivers.

#### 5.4 Why does my OmniGo take up to 5 seconds to react after being turned on?

When the OmniGo is turned on, it scans your SRAM card to make sure that it is valid. In some SRAM cards this can cause up to a 5 second delay. Cards that exibit this problem lack attribute memory. To guarentee that you card will not have this problem make sure to specify, when you order the card, that it must have 2KB of attribute memory.

FlashRAM cards to do not exibit this delay.

#### 5.5 Where can I find SRAM cards for the OmniGo?

Most OmniGo users recommend ordering SRAM from Pretec. Make sure to specify that you want the card to have 2KB of attibute memory to prevent access delays.

Visit Pretec's web site at [http://www.pretec.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20010424084421/http://www.pretec.com/).

#### 5.6 Where can I find FlashRAM cards for the OmniGo?

You can order ATA FrashRAM cards from Pretec. that work in the OmniGo. Also Sandisk makes an ATA FlashRAM card that works in the OmniGo.

Visit Pretec's web site at [http://www.pretec.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20010424084421/http://www.pretec.com/).  
Visit Sandisk's web site at [http://www.sandisk.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20010424084421/http://www.sandisk.com/).

#### 5.7 Increasing storage with a file/disk compressor.

The GEOS on the OmniGo relies on DOS for all file and disk functions; you can take advantage of this to increase storage capacity with file and disk compressors. Marcus Groeber has successfully installed the dLite run-time file decompressor. Stacker, a disk compressor, has also been sucessfully used on the OmniGo.

#### 5.8 How do I install and use dLite?

dLite is a runtime file decompressor which can be used to increase storage on the OmniGo. The dLite package consists of two files, DLITE.COM and DPRESS.EXE. dpress.exe is a utility to compress files and dlite.com is a resident program which decompresses files on demand and in the background whenever they are accessed.

Installing dLite on the OmniGo:

1.  Obtain the distribution archive of dLite, the latest version is dlite111.zip  
    You can get it from Marcus Groeber at [http://www.mgroeber.de/geos.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20010408035953/http://www.mgroeber.de/geos.htm)
2.  Open B:\\AUTOEXEC.BAT with OgEDIT or use OmniCom to download it to your PC and open it in EDIT or NOTEPAD.
3.  Change the last lines of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, starting from the label ":runGEOS", to read:
4.  :runGEOS
    
    b:  
    cd \\  
    dlite /I /F+  
    cd geoworks  
    geos
    
5.  Upload, using OmniCom, DLITE.COM and the modified AUTOEXEC.BAT (if edited on your PC) to the root directory of your B: drive.
6.  You can use the DPRESS.EXE utility to compress any files you like and upload them to the OmniGo, where you can use them just as you normally would.

Please remember that dLite is shareware, and as far as I know, the author will still accept registrations for it - so play fair and register if you go on using it.

Thanks to Marcus Groeber for this information.

#### 5.9 How do I install and use Stacker?

Stacker is commercial disk compressor from Stac, which can be used to compress your SRAM and FlashRAM cards.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. RETAIN A BACKUP OF YOUR SRAM/FLASHRAM DISK.

What you'll need:

*   Stacker 3.0 or newer with STACPALM.EXE
*   A DOS Mode driver installed.
*   OmniCom or some other tranfer application.
*   An SRAM or FlashRAM card to compress.

How to install Stacker on your OmniGo:

1.  Copy STACKER.COM and STACPALM.EXE from your PC to B:\\STACKER on your OmniGo.
2.  From DOS, run STACPALM as follows:
3.  STACPALM d: /S:sss.ss /R=n.n
    
    Where d: is the drive letter of your RAM card (C: for SRAM and E: for FlashRAM), sss.ss is the size in MB that you want to compress and n.n is the expected compression ratio. If you leave off the size, the default is to compress the entire card. If you leave off compression ratio, the default is 2.0.
    
4.  Use OgEDIT or another text file editor to edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT and include the following line near the bottom:
5.  device = b:\\stacker\\stacker.com d:
    
    where d: is the drive letter of your RAM card.
    
6.  Save the file and reboot. You now have a stacked drive.

Notes:

*   STACPALM does not compresses existing files on the RAM card, it simply creates a stacker volume using the remaining free space. When the Stacker drive is mounted, you'll be unable to access information stored in the uncompressed part of the card.
*   If the Omnigo appears to lock up during startup, then there might have been a error and it's pausing so you can press a key. Press a key and it should boot normally but you won't have access to the stacked partition.
*   You can dynamically mount and unmount stacker drives by using the STACKER.COM program in DOS.
*   To get rid of Stacker, unmount the drive, format the card, then take STACKER.COM out of your CONFIG.SYS. If you don't want to format the card, you can unmount the drive and then delete the STACVOL file (you'll need some way to make it not read-only, hidden and system).
*   I would suggest that before you install stacker you place backup copies
*   leave a little uncompressed space on your RAM card to place backup copies of STACKER.COM and OgText. If you're Omnigo RAM ever get erased, then the uncompressed portion of the card will become visible and you'll be able to use OgText to reinstall stacker.

### 6 DOS Mode

#### 6.1 What is OmniGo DOS Mode?

The OmniGo contains a special version of DOS in its ROM. This version of DOS is normally not accessable because, by default, the OmniGo boots directly into GEOS. You can however, prevent GEOS from loading and work directly in DOS.

#### 6.2 How can I get to DOS Mode?

What you'll need:

*   A DOS Mode driver (recommeded: Omniswp)
*   OmniCom for transfering data to/from the OmniGo.
*   Some knowledge of DOS.
*   OgEDIT recommended for editing AUTOEXEC.BAT

How to enable DOS mode:

1.  Upload DOS Mode driver to the OmniGo B:\\ directory.
2.  Open B:\\AUTOEXEC.BAT with OgEDIT or use OmniCom to download it to your PC and open it in EDIT or NOTEPAD.
3.  Remove "geos" from the last line of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and add the name of DOS Mode driver. Example (with omniswp DOS driver):
4.  :runGEOS
    
    b:  
    cd \\  
    cd geoworks  
    omniswp i
    
5.  Save the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. (If editing on PC, upload it using OmniCom).
6.  Reboot your OmniGo (SHIFT-ON-NEXT). You'll now be in DOS Mode.

#### 6.3 How do I get back into GEOS from DOS Mode?

You can load GEOS by simply typing "geos" at the DOS prompt.

If you have a keyboard remapping program installed, such as Omniswp, you'll need to uninstall it before loading GEOS.

#### 6.4 Why do my batteries drain faster in DOS Mode?

There is no power management in DOS, therefore your OmniGo runs at full power all the time. This can cause significant batery drain. It is not recommended that you run in DOS mode very long.

### 7 Developing for the OmniGo

#### 7.1 How I can develop for the OmniGo?

You can develop software for the OmniGo by using the OmniGo SDK, IZL, or by creating applications to run in DOS mode.

#### 7.2 What is the Omnigo SDK?

The OmniGo SDK is a collection of tools and documentation for creating native OmniGo GEOS applications. OmniGo applications are usually written in C with a special preprocessor called GOC (Geos Object C). GOC adds syntax to C to access the object-oriented features of GEOS. You must have Borland C version 3.1 to 4.51 in order to compile GEOS applications. In order to debug you need a second computer connected via a serial cable.

The older GEOS Ensemble SDK will also allow the creation of OmniGo applications, and the OmniGo SDK will allow the creation of Ensemble applications.

Geoworks is working on a new version of Nokia 9000 communicator SDK which runs in Windows NT and removes the requirement of needing a second computer. Such an SDK can be used to write GEOS applications for the OmniGo.

Geoworks has information on all GEOS SDK's available on their web site at [http://www.geoworks.com/devrel/](https://web.archive.org/web/19990218141232/http://www.geoworks.com/devrel/).

#### 7.3 What is IZL?

IZL stands for Integrated Zoomer Language and was orginally developed for the Zoomer PDA by John Feras. It is small basic-like interpreted programming language that allows easy creation of OmniGo applications.  Each IZL program is compiled into a format which can then be executed by the IZL interpreter.  The interpreter is a free download.

John has been concentrating his efforts on building CASL, which is a language similar to IZL for the PalmPilot.  A port of CASL to the OmniGo is planned. 

For more information on IZL visit the IZL homepage at [http://www.netaxs.com/~jferas/izl.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/19961221133743/http://www.netaxs.com/~jferas/izl.htm).  
For more information on CASL visit the CASLsoft homepage at [http://www.caslsoft.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20010424084421/http://www.caslsoft.com/).

### 8 Communication

#### 8.1 Can I read Internet E-mail with the OmniGo?

ArtsCom from Artsoft can be used to send and received Internet E-mail from your OmniGo.   It supports only PPP Internet connections and you might have trouble if your ISP uses some kind of unusual login procedure.

A preview release of ArtsCom is available from the Artsoft web site.  It will expire on a certain date and limited the number of messages you can send.

Artsoft product page: [http://www.artsoft.ru/products.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20010406102114/http://artsoft.ru/eng/products.htm).

#### 8.2 Can I use my OmniGo for Web Browsing?

WebMagik is an HTML file viewer for the OmniGo and Desktop GEOS. Supports most HTML 2.0 tags but it does not support frames, tables or forms. Also, only GIF images are supported. You can download a beta version of WebMagik from [http://www.breadbox.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20010424084421/http://www.breadbox.com/).

Future versions of WebMagik will incorperate Internet connectivity.

#### 8.3 Can I fax from my OmniGo?

ArtsCom from Artsoft can be used to send WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) faxes from your OmniGo.

A preview release of ArtsCom is available from the Artsoft web site.  It will expire on a certain date and limited the number of faxes you can send.

Artsoft product page: [http://www.artsoft.ru/products.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20010424084421/http://www.artsoft.ru/products.htm).

### 9 Customizing the Omnigo

#### 9.1 Note and Warning on Customizing the OmniGo.

Please backup all data before attempting any of these operations. It is also recommended that you obtain and install a DOS mode driver for the Omnigo (so that you are not locked out of the machine if anything goes wrong). If you become locked out of your Omnigo after any of these procedures, Press 'C' during startup to return your Omnigo to its orginal state (warning this causes all data to be lost).

If you are making modifications to the GEOS.INI or NET.INI please retain backups of the originals which can be restored from DOS mode if GEOS fails to boot.

File Manager, OgText, Text Editor and any other programs mentioned in this section are available from [http://omnigo.home.ml.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20010424084421/http://omnigo.home.ml.org/).

#### 9.2 How can I remove unused programs from the Home Screen?

By default, GEOS is configured to look on the ROM SYS: drive for programs and documents and then look in your B: and C: drives. By editing your GEOS.INI and NET.INI you can make GEOS ignore the programs on the SYS: drive. You can then copy only the programs you want on the Home Screen from the ROM drive.

_Please see note and warning at the beginning of this section._

What you'll need:

*   File Manager or OmniCom.
*   A DOS Mode driver installed.
*   Text Editor or OgTEXT.

Instructions:

1.  Use File Manager, Omnicom or DOS to copy NET.INI from the A:\\GEOWORKS directory to B:\\GEOWORKS.
2.  Use File Manager, Omnicom or DOS to create a new directory called B:\\GEOWORKS\\WORLD\\APPS.
3.  Use File Manager, Omnicom or DOS to copy all the files in B:\\GEOWORKS\\WORLD to B:\\GEOWORKS\\WORLD\\APPS.
4.  Use File Manager, Omnicom or DOS to copy GEOS.INI to GEOS.NEW.
5.  Use File Manager, Omnicom or DOS to copy GEOS.INI to GEOS.BAK.
6.  Using Text Editor or OgText, edit the GEOS.NEW file:
7.  **Change:**  
    \[paths\]  
    ini = A:\\GEOWORKS\\NET.INI
    
    **To:**  
    \[paths\]  
    ini = B:\\GEOWORKS\\NET.INI
    
8.  Using Text Editor or OgText, edit the NET.INI file:
9.  **Change:**  
    \[paths\]  
    top = SYS:\\
    
    **To:**  
    \[paths\]  
    top = B:\\GEOWORKS  
    userdata = SYS:\\USERDATA  
    system = SYS:\\SYSTEM  
    document = SYS:\\DOCUMENT
    
10.  Using Text Editor or OgText, edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
11.  **Change:**  
    cd \\geoworks  
    geos
    
    **To:**  
    cd \\geoworks  
    copy \\geoworks\\GEOS.NEW \\geoworks\\GEOS.INI  
    geos
    
    **Note:** FN-2 is the '\\' key  
    **Note:** If you are using DOS mode on the Omnigo, you can copy the file from DOS instead of editing your Autoexec.bat.
    
12.  Reboot your Omnigo (Shift-On-Next)
13.  When GEOS is finished loading you should see nothing in your Home Screen except the Apps directory and any programs which you have installed.
14.  Use File Manager, Omnicom, or DOS to selectively move the files you want to from the World\\Apps directory to the World directory.

#### 10.1 Can I purchase cheaper OmniGo goods from the USA?

It seems that the USA is better served with OmniGo accessories than some other countries. For instance, in the UK the USA prices seem a lot more attractive than the local prices, and some new software is available in the USA first. There are American companies who will ship to other countries.

The basic process is Contact the American company by phone, mail, FAX, or Web page and establish availability of goods, cost, delivery cost, and delivery time. The onus is on you to ensure you are purchasing the correct and compatible goods.

Determine if the deal is worth it. In the UK, and most probably other countries, you will be charged duty at the local end.

Place and pay for an order - Visa or similar is the most convenient method.

On delivery be prepared to pay local duty and taxes. In the UK payment is made to the courier (express delivery), or for regular mail you will visit the post office to pick-up and pay.

Examples:

February 1997. From XXX, to UK work address, contacted via FAX. Paid with VISA card, details in 2nd FAX. HP connectivity pack (USD 89) + express delivery (USD 33).

March 1997. From Reboot Technologies USA, to UK address, contacted via phone. 1MB Grid SRAM (USD 40). Delivered in 13 days via normal post. Pick-up and pay duty/VAT at post office (GBP 9). Total cost GBP 43 + five minute phone call. Local cost GBP 99.
